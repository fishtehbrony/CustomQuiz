Here's a generalised version of a flash card quiz I made in Computer Science. Somewhere near the bottom of Quiz.py, there's a directory you need to change according to your needs. It's currently Z:/Documents/Quizzes.
Change that directory to the same thing in quiz_config.py, and you're good to go. Make a quiz in quiz_config.
NOTE: Feel free to drop out of the quiz_conig, AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT BEING ASKED TO WRITE AN ANSWER. This'll cause bugs in the quiz.
Enter the name of the quiz you plan to take upon starting Quiz.py, and you're good to go!
